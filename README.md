# gcpForBeginners

## Introduction
Hello and welcome to this repository. I hope you find some useful comands and maybe tips that I might include in the future related to Google Cloud Platform and Kubernetes (for now).

### What is this?
I consider myself a bit of a cloud agnostic, although my most experience lies within the Microsoft Azure world. I also think that some cloud providers are better suited for a specific project than others.

So, that being said and even though the repository's name is a bit of a spoiler, I'm going to put here some, erm... We could say cheatsheets based on the course I'm currently doing as a refresher (I'll do another one that hopefully will dig deeper).

The course I'm talking about is [this one](https://www.udemy.com/course/google-cloud-digital-leader-certification/) and it's called 'GCP for Beginners - Become a Google Cloud Digital Leader'.

### How to use this repository
My idea, which I hope to maintain in time, is to use what I'm currently learning as of November 2023 and start amplifying the contents of this repository with code that might be useful in professional / productive solutions and its environments.

At the early stages of this, you'll mainly see a folder that contains references to the Google Cloud Digital Leader's course and its corresponding chapter numbers.
